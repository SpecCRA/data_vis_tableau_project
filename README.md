# data_vis_tableau_project

## Short Summary
This project looks at the top 50 NBA scoring seasons by points per game since 1981. I chose 1981 as the starting point because that is the official introduction of the NBA 3-point line. The finished story can be viewed [here.](https://public.tableau.com/profile/ben.xiao#!/vizhome/top_50_nba_scorers_revised/Story1)
